### About

Senior adjunct instructor in English composition and fiction writing, with an MFA from Portland State University and 10 years of editing, teaching, and writing experience. I've designed and taught courses in composition and creative writing at Ohio University, Clark College, and PSU. As a freelance editor I've worked on two novels and _EmpoWord: A Student-Centered Anthology & Handbook for College Writers_, which has reached over 40,000 students. I am the co-editor of Old Pal ([oldpalmag.com](https://oldpalmag.com)) and I've built community development resources through Literary Portland (LitPDX, [literaryportland.org](https://literaryportland.org)) to become a top search result and essential info hub.

I have coding and design experience with HTML, CSS, MySQL, Javascript, PHP, C++, C#, and Unity. Graphic design experience with Photoshop, InDesign, GIMP, Affinity Designer, and Krita. Website design for personal and professional uses. Design and management experience with WordPress. Experience in radio production and voice work with co-hosted radio shows on MU's student radio network.

In addition to my MFA from PSU I also obtained an MA from Ohio University and a BA from Miami University, also in Ohio.
