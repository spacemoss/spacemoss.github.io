				<h2>Submissions</h2>
				<p>
					We take unique, experimental, or non-traditional works. Uniquely applied uses of standard/new forms, experimental deviations into the unknown, and methods that fall outside tradition. Reinvention is not required, but invention is encouraged.
				</p>
				<p>
					Deadline for <b>Issue 2</b> is <b>May 1st 2009</b>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Send submissions to <a href="mailto:s@a.org">s@a.org</a>.
				</p>

				<h1>Technical Details</h1>
					We are currently taking poetry (1-3 pages), fiction (1-10 pages), audio, video, art, and photography submissions. All works included in the magazine will be converted to black and white at this time. However full color works can be published on the website with author's consent. There is no required format (Microsoft Word, etc.) as long as we can open it with an easily accessible program.
				<p>
					We do take Simultaneous Submissions, but please notify us if they're accepted elsewhere. We also ask that you inform us if and where your work has been published before so that we can give proper credits. Cover letters are not required but may be included if you wish.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are no set reading times, so you may send submissions at any time, however we do note deadlines for issue inclusion (see above). We will reply within a week at the earliest and three months at the latest.
				</p>
				<p>
					At this time we do not publicly accept hard copy paper submissions, but arrangements can be made via email if necessary (i.e. due to technological limitations or requirements of the work).
				</p>
				<p>
					Authors are compensated with a free copy of the issue featuring their work and our undying gratitude. We unfortunately are unable to award any monetary payments.
