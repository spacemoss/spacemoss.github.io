					Louise Melroy was sitting in her green easy chair, leaning back, her slippered feet resting on the ottoman. She had a glass of iced tea on the table next to her, and the remote control within easy reach. The Price is Right was on. Just as they were about to reveal the first Showcase Showdown, her husband George stumbled in through the front door, followed by a bright flood of early winter sun. He kicked the door shut behind him and a slow smile spread across his face. He had sleepy eyes. He was drunk.
				</p>
				<p>
					He was harmless, a good-time drunk. Louise didn’t bother getting up.
				</p>
				<p>
					“Hello there,” she said.
				</p>
				<p>
					George was the kind of man who took any excuse to celebrate. What could it be today? Did his team win a game last night? Did he have a good dream?
				</p>
				<p>
					Her knitting needles were in her hands and she hadn’t decided what to make for lunch yet. George just stood there grinning, his cheeks balled up under his eyes, his mouth spread wide. It was a smile she remembered from early in their marriage, when he would bring things home from work to surprise her – pens, paperweights, sweatshirts with company logos on the chest – everything she ever wanted he had given her.
				</p>
				<p>
					“What is it?” she said, “What’s the smile for?” The treats had long since dried up; she no longer wanted anything.
				</p>
				<p>
					“How long we been married, Lou?” George put his empty hands on his hips. It was some kind of riddle with him, it always was.
				</p>
				<p>
					“Fifty-six years” she said, “give or take.”
				</p>
				<p>
					This she said to refer to his affair, the seven months he spent in Indianapolis with his secretary all those years ago. Time she was allowed to subtract. The whole time he was gone she continued to go about the business of taking care of the house and the kids. She washed dishes and scrubbed floors and checked for dirt behind ears and didn’t allow herself to think of anything beyond the next thing that needed done. One night, as she lay in bed in their room alone, there was a knock on the door. It was the middle of the night. It could only be him. His key was in his pocket, but at least he’d had the decency to knock. She always remembered that, and was glad for it. He had given her a stricken look, like a man asking to be put back in prison, but at least he had stood on the porch and waited for her to let him in.
				</p>
				<p>
					“Yes,” he said. “Fifty-six years.”
				</p>
				<p>
					“Uh-huh.”
				</p>
				<p>
					“And do you remember where we always said we’d go?”
				</p>
				<p>
					Louise didn’t know what he was talking about. This is where they were from, where they’d always been. She couldn’t remember ever saying anything different.
				</p>
				<p>
					"No,” she said. “Hawaii?” Her honeymoon bathing suit had gone to waste at the Hollingsworth Holiday Inn down on Route 5, with its small pool off the highway. George said they needed to use the money to pay off some bills and exchanged the Hawaii tickets for cash. The sound of cars rushing past was deafening even when she slipped underwater and floated on her back. The sky was a vague light blue, clouds and smog and air blended together like paste. She pretended it was the deep blue and stark white sky over Oahu, that if she lowered her gaze she’d see volcanoes on the horizon, red lava and white flowers.
				</p>
				<p>
					“No,” he said. His turned his head to the side and tightened his mouth.
				</p>
				<p>
					“Well, where?” she said. “I don’t have all day to guess.” Though she did.
				</p>
				<p>
					She sighed, glanced down at the row she was still knitting, and then looked back at the television to see what the blond from Tennessee was screaming and jumping up and down about, what she’d won.
				</p>
				<p>
					“Arizona!” he said. He held his arms up and out like he was making the sign for victory and he smiled with all his teeth. He stumbled backwards just a bit and leaned forward to catch himself, as if he was contemplating flight, raring up to get a running start.
				</p>
				<p>
					The buzzer for the washing machine went off in the other room.
				</p>
				<p>
					“No,” she said. “Never in my life have I wanted to go to Arizona. George, you’re drunk.” She blinked and looked down at her lap, at the pile of soft green yarn, the first third of a scarf she was making for George. He was just standing there next to her now, swaying slightly, his arms slowly sinking. Louise wondered if she’d gone too far, saying he was drunk. That was something they’d agreed not to talk about anymore.
