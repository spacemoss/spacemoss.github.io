				<p>Writers [Bloc] was formed in 2007 by <a href="http://www.users.muohio.edu/brownlq">Quinton Brown</a> in <a href="http://www.cityofoxford.org/">Oxford, Ohio</a> on the <a href="http://www.muohio.edu">Miami University</a> campus. Writers [Bloc] is largely made up of Miami University students but is not exclusive in its membership and promotes any works from the local area. The group focuses primarily on promoting and developing written art forms. Writers [Bloc] activities include creative work shops, publishing, distribution, and live readings.</p>
				<p>Membership is free and open to all who wish to participate and hone their writing abilities or help others in doing so. To join feel free to <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> us!</p>
				<p><b>Workshop Meetings:</b> Writers [Bloc] currently meets on Wednesdays at 7 pm in the Howe Writing Center (located inside King Library). You can join us anytime.<br/>
	Walk-in workshops (not having signed up for a date) may sometimes be possible but due to time limitations there are no guarantees. It is best to sign up via email for a specific date to be workshopped.</p>
