				<h2>Conjunction</h2>
				<h1>by <a href="../">Alex Dannemiller</a> &copy; 2008</h1>
				<p>Agitated. Fucking agitated. There should be something happening, something happening with me, something changing, some activity, something that isn't the same anymore. Antsy, flying ants up my legs, keeping them tapping, always moving, antsy, nervous not so much, just agitated. Some things are broken. Some are wearing out, some are dirty, some things are just annoying me with unintentional strife. Can I say something? Can I really say something when it is neither their fault nor their doing, just happening, are they doing it intentionally? Maybe. But probably not. Tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap tap. Agitated.</p><p>Cigarettes go as only as far as your lips but the concept goes deeper. Smoke the pale blue moon away. Your death lingers in the air, sedating nothing but trampled hobos. Five minutes ago I could have said hello. Are we all just ticking time bombs? Waiting for our moment, our. moment. to go off? Why does punctuation have to follow any set way, can't we use it as an art? Can't not this tortured pen find a way to spit back? Double negatives hide things in all fields. Flip the picture, the sentence, what is it that I or you or fuck see? There is no mind here to speak, only the raw emotion of habitats pulled too tightly to the skin. Echo location can't even find your soul. I can see the phantom hour where the deer have roamed your dormitoried halls. You were never invited yet you exist. Contemporary thoughts are only good if they happened before 1900. Everything else is meaningless bullshit that can't be selected as a divine work. All my verbs are hateful. All my words are fear. Masochists are best when writing a torture of their own soul. Do Masochists get off when they are dumped? Rejected? Sneered at? When their friends do not call them to come to a party do they masturbate at their own self loathing? Would Marquis de Sade envy Jesus at the crucifixion? Do ants eat nicotine? And do they get anything out of it?</p><p>One little burnt tree kissed too many times with the sun overflowing from a cup so high. It is a color licked from the palette. But I want it to be angrier. Trees are the ultimate twisted existence and look at the beauty that they have made. Lights should not be on when it is noon or more.</p><p>[Even when one can think that they can look at themselves without restriction can they really with such a name as the tiger. we the people can not discern what you are saying to the penis of my cunt and I wish that everything would just stop because it is all so loud and there are no more hairs to split and we can not see out the windows for they are too steamed up with our own sensual pleasure of dew drops on grass and can not see the people that pass because we are blind to everything but the smell and eat of the earth and what is that noise cause we can not hear but we see several dragons. Dragons are not allowed inside. Blue is everywhere. It's potatoes for you. My foot is a television you can watch on the big toe but the signal is weaker on the others. My love is a hoop that girls jump through avoiding the sides and lighting things on fire. I hate me cry this out of your soul but thatâ€™s just a lie.]</p>
