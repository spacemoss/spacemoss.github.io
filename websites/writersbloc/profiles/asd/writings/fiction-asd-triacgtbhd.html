				<h2>That Randle Is A Cool Guy Too Bad He's Dead</h2>
				<h1>by <a href="../">Alex Dannemiller</a> &copy; 2008</h1>
				<p>"Did you say you loved me?"<br/>"No."<br/>"Will you say it?"<br/>"No."</p><p>"You have 30 seconds..."<br/>The loud analog clock behind Randle ground, a spring popped, and a hand swung brutally to a 3. Tock.<br/>"Well... I'm sorry but you've made a complete waste of your own time." The Man across from Randle, who didn't care to identify himself and nor did Randle care to inquire about, stood up from the ergonomic nightmare that was a bare steel chair.<br/>"That sucks for me." Randle smiled smugly, his face wanted anyone that could see it to 'eat shit and die'. The man turned around suddenly, his face red, his finger out and straight as a nun's ruler, his eyes furrow with his brows following quickly.<br/>"You sat there for forty minutes and didn't say a damn word!"<br/>"Hey you didn't say much either." Randle shrugged and leaned back pompously in his chair.<br/>"I counted!" The man slammed a fist on the steel table, pahp!<br/>"I hope you got paid for that effort."<br/>"Listen!" The man shoved the table into Randle's stomach causing him to bend forward and all six feet to slap the ground, "They're going to make you dead for being a little dick and I'm the one that's going to have to kill you. How does that sound?"<br/>Randle coughed as his lunges recouped, "Well it is a Monday, so I'm honestly not that surprised."<br/>The man clenched his fists tight, took a deep breath, and exhaled the world from his shoulders. "I'll be back with a gun." He then turned and walked out the door. The metal on metal penetration of the lock loudly clicking into the frame echoed through the barely decorated room.<br/>Randle looked up at the security camera in the corner that looked back down on him looking back up at it in a terrible mirror description. His smile went sideways and he slumped over the desk. His right hand began to sketch something into the table with his finger nail while his left hand and arm swooped around it in an attempt to hide the work.</p><p>"A light."<br/>"I never got that whole concept."<br/>"What?"<br/>"'A light.'"<br/>"You never got the concept of a light?"<br/>"No. Ok. You're asking for an object that provides light as well as sets things on fire, yeah?"<br/>"Oh god. Really? You're going to do this?"<br/>"But literally you're asking for light, as in the theoretical property that some objects give off which allows humans to see in otherwise dark environments."<br/>"Is this your way to try and stop me from smoking?"<br/>"... But wait... even asking for a light doesn't make sense, because there is never 'one' light, but many lights that provide the overall sensation of light."<br/>"Fuck! Ok! Can I have a fucking lighter?!... fucking shit..."<br/>"Ooohhh, a lighter, ok sure."<br/>"... I'm going to stab you in the neck..."</p><p>The door opened again and The Man steps inside, his polished black shoes entered first. Randle knew this because he was under the table and looked at the door.<br/>"Hiding under the table is not going to help." The Man said as he stood at the edge of the table and made no attempt to bend down and look at Randle.<br/>"I'm not hiding." Randle continued to draw with his fingernail on the metal surface, "I ran out of room on the top."<br/>"Out of room for-" The Man looked at the table and stopped. Scrolled along the entirety was writing and pictures faintly etched into the soft metal of the table. "What the hell is this? You fucked up our table!"<br/>"Hey! I improved it damnit!"<br/>The Man looked closer at the top and began reading. "A story... cute."<br/>"You're in it, Mr. ShinyShoes." Randle tapped the man's shiny shoes, The Man ignored this but gripped the gun tighter slightly. It was clutched tightly in his right hand as he read the story.<br/>"Oh, also, you're totally ignoring me." The Man heard Randle's voice from behind him but by then it was extremely too late as a metal chair walloped him in the back of his head and slammed the front of his head against the metal table. The Man went limp. Randle pried the gun out of The Man's hand and cocked it. "Score one for literature."<br/>The door was unlocked so Randle simply left.</p><p>"Why aren't we dead yet?"<br/>"We'll die when we're supposed to die."<br/>"That's stupid. I want to die now."<br/>"Then kill yourself."<br/>"That's lame. Suicide is lame."<br/>"Then just shut up and wait."<br/>"...What would I kill myself with anyway?"<br/>"Whatever it is, I'd probably use it first."</p><p>Randle opened a door marked "Exit" and if he had had a hat he would have had a hat no longer as a strong gust of wind almost sucked him out the door. Catching himself and holding himself tightly Randle clung to the side of the door.<br/>"Well shit."<br/>Randle was on a train. This was news to Randle. He closed the door and leaned against it... then slowly slid down until he sat on the floor.<br/>His thoughts ran like this: "I could jump. But I won't be much alive to run after landing. I could hide outside. But I won't be able to hold on very long and that then leads to issue number one."<br/>He heard a clang from down the hall and looked up to see The Man standing there slouching against the wall and holding a chair. His other hand held his head, face palmed.<br/>"I'm returning this to you!" The Man held up the chair, "Can't get anywhere now, you little shit."<br/>Randle sighed and stood up. He looked at the gun then at The Man. Randle thought about it, but decided he wasn't one for murder and began running down the opposite end of the hall. The Man was laughing behind him.</p><p>"At least we're not naked."<br/>"Why?"<br/>"Have you ever seen someone that died naked and looked dignified?"<br/>"I've never seen anyone that died naked."<br/>"Me neither."<br/>"How do you know they don't look dignified then?"<br/>"Well, I'm guessing. It's hard to look dignified while naked."<br/>"That's not true."<br/>"Could be."</p><p>Randle tried to wedge a mop against the door to stop The Man from coming in, but it was a mop, so it broke instead. The heavy iron door flew open slamming against the wall and swinging back shut on The Man.<br/>"Fuck!" Randle heard The Man shout from the other side. The door opened again this time under more control. "You little bastard," The Man was shuffling around in the darkness of the small room, "When I fi-" his hand touched Randle's face. Randle pulled the cord for the light and the small closet lit up. Randle had mistakenly hid in a small utility closet and there was not much room for him to hide. "Oh." The Man was almost dissapointed looking around the small room he realized Randle's mistake. "Well ha! Brat!" The Man grabbed him by the neck and that's when Randle put the gun to The Man's temple. "Oh balls." The Man sighed.<br/>"Yes, balls indeed." Randle pushed the man slowly out the door with the gun to The Man's chest. Stepping outside the door Randle heard a click and a gun was pressed firmly against his own temple, "Balls!" Randle whined.<br/>"Enough balls!" Another man said and grabbed Randle by his shirt's shoulder. Randle's finger slipped in the jerking movement and he shot The Man who immediately fell dead as bullets do cause. The other man stopped for a moment, regarded The Man, then looked at Randle who stared down at The Man with some slight sympathy that this was how his journey would end, very carelessly at the mistake of a clumsy finger.<br/>"C'mon." Randle was tugged away and his gun clanged to the floor next to The Man.</p><p>"I'd do anything for you, you know."<br/>"Would you shut up?"<br/>"Ok, maybe not everything. Do I really annoy you that much?"<br/>"Yes."<br/>"Why?"<br/>"... Well we aren't really in the best of situations."<br/>"I've seen worse."<br/>"And all your comments just... irritate me."<br/>"Wh-"<br/>"You aren't funny."<br/>"... All I ever wanted was your love."<br/>"Then you should have been someone else."<br/>"... I'm sorry."<br/>"For what?"<br/>"For letting the door close."<br/>The red door slid open.</p><p>The door opened. Randle looked inside the room as the man was shoving the gun at the small of his back, it tickled. The room was large and square. Every side of it was covered in old red rusted metal. A girl sat in the center of the room. A red door was behind her.<br/>"Whose that?" Randle whispered to the man.<br/>"Get in." The man demanded, shoving the gun harder at Randle's back.<br/>"Not with some st-" the girl looked up at their bickering, "Hey I know her! You," Randle turned to the man who immediately put the gun at his gut, "you're an ass!" Randle swung his hand and sliced the man’s face crossways with the switchblade he gripped. The man let go of the door and it swung shut on its own with a deafening clang.<br/>"Fuck!" The man screamed grabbing his face and shooting wildly where Randle once was. Randle wasn't there anymore because he was too busy stepping behind the man and stabbing him in the kidneys. The man screamed again and Randle grabbed the gun.<br/>"Total. Ass." Randle shot him in the head. He opened the door and walked into the room towards Lynn, "I was supposed to be goo-"<br/>"Don't let the do-" The door slammed loudly behind him.<br/>"Oops. It's ok though, he's dead, we'll jus-"<br/>"It doesn't open from the inside." She was notably angry and didn't bother getting up from the floor.<br/>"Well that's a terribly stupid design." Randle sat down next to her. "What about the red door?"<br/>"That opens and we're dead." Her voice was so full of definition that Randle worried she had become a dictionary.<br/>"Whhyyy?"<br/>"It's funny."<br/>"Death is quite hi-"<br/>"Zombies."<br/>"Hah! Seriously though." Randle looked at the door and considered what could be behind it. It had no outside markings and wouldn't be regarded as a door if it had not been door shaped.<br/>"Hundred percent."<br/>"How do you know? Maybe it's just cheese or something." Randle got up and examined the door, he sniffed at it, "Really bad cheese..."<br/>"That guy was really chatty, he was telling me all about how I was going to die at the hands of terrible losers turned into zombies."<br/>"Hippies?"<br/>"I didn't believe him but it doesn’t matter." She turned and looked at him, "Come sit with me."<br/>Randle sat down and looked at her, "Did you say you loved me?"</p>
