				<h2>I Am Not Respecting</h2>
				<h1>by <a href="../">Alex Dannemiller</a> &copy; 2008</h1>
				My mind isn't what it used to be,k he said without an audience to hear.<br />
Time keeps me insane and out of my mind.<br />
Papered walls of sticky yellow keep my thoughts.<br />
Friends one, two, say to let go, let another take control<br />
Friends one, two, say to do what I am doing because there is no other way.<br />
I plan, I scheme, I want make happen.<br />
Everywhere I see the projection of an image that needs to be corporeal.<br />
Scent memory, a spear upon my breast.<br />
Crying, sobbing, shouting, destruction of everything in my head.<br />
Friends, four, five, I want to disgust<br />
To make their faces flush with anger, hate, confused betrayal.<br />
Craving the breaking for something feeling real.<br />
Break my jaw, my ribs, my grey matter.<br />
I am dark and wasted, want to be colored black and deeper.<br />
Disobeying all morals I had once held,<br />
disobeying rules I know are good for me.<br />
I want to hurt because I have absence.<br />
I want absence because I hurt.<br />
Vice versa circles reasons my mouth bites if I speak.<br />
Ca sera I am. Ca sera I despise.<br />
They try to help but know it is effortless.<br />
Twirl me down the spiral staircase, never to return from the analogy I blatantly state.<br />
Small woodland creatures envy the adorableness of the souls I'm thinking of.<br />
I am the red and try as you may you can never swallow me whole<br />
only partly.<br />
Write the skin, lick the salt, burn with my fluid.<br />
Tundra waves push me back, green, white, green.<br />
I would not be here if some part of me wasn't still sane.<br />
I not want be here.<br />
Thoughts, desires, passion, I can not speak yet.<br />
Wait, always, requirement, wait, need, still to do, wait, her, growth, wait, opportunity relies on time time time an ugly little word I furiously wish would die by my jaws.<br />
Fuck.<br />
There will be more of me.</br>
