				<h2>City Lights</h2>
				<h1>by <a href="../">Alex Dannemiller</a> &copy; 2008</h1>
				The sky was tan, call it polution, light or chemical, it turned the sky into a grocery bag, paper. He sat on his boat, small for two no more, rolling with every pull of the moon. His chin buried in his hand stationed by his knee, his cigarette dangling wantanly from his mouth.<br/>
"Another bitter night." He sighed, "All those stories, just shining from those lights...<br/>
We saw them coming,<br/>
By our lights,<br/>
They saw us standing,<br/>
By our lights,<br/>
We whispered to one another,<br/>
Speaking of our deaths,<br/>
Held our guns to our ears and listened,<br/>
To them speaking of our deaths,<br/>
Oh but for want of peace we fight,<br/>
Oh but for want of love we war,<br/>
In the end we have neither,<br/>
Only broken souls,<br/>
With the lights remaining."<br/>
He shifted under a cold gust of wind, buttoning his rough coat tighter. He spit the cigarette over the side of the boat as it singed his lips.<br/>
"Bunch of hippy bullshit propaganda. Shoulda shot em all too."<br/>
The nighting gale perched on the side of the boat and gave him a wondering cock of the head.<br/>
"We'll get em tonight, don't worry." His hand tapped at the side of his fire stick, locked and ready. The bird jumped back in the bow, his fists grabbing the paddles, arms twisting into action and the boat glided along the water jerkingly.<br/>
<br/>
	The dag town was quiet with the moans of death bound patrons waiting in a long hospital row that spanned the length of the river. Patients of all ages and size clutched to the walls brittle and falling. As he walked few noticed him, too caught up in their own misery, their faces covered with stank filled cloths older than they. His pace swift but careful, hunting along the hunched forms, the shallowed door ways, the new holes made by the frantic burrowing for safety of lost children. The brim of his hat fluttered stiff in the wind, his face covered in shadow, his coat was self-torn and tattered at its edges, he was a chameleon.<br/>
	Up above, three square holes that could barely pass as windows filled the gap between him, a light projected from the fourth, bluest in hue with a constant pulse that only bothered the eye slightly. Stairs were a luxury in a subsection like this, corrugated pieces of steel stacked atop each other sliding unrelentlessly under pressure, rope covered in filth draped through a hole splintered at the edges, old TVs stacked together by a five year old cracking and falling into their screens. He made his way through all of these before reaching the fourth level. Through a man-sized hole he watched elongated fingers flutter over keys in a foreign language. The monitor flickered slowly with each passing of its laser, shooting colors of mostly white onto the polished glass perched on its stand. Exposed wires in piles of endless curl, steel with steel chips and transistors and small rounded things that looked like pills were soldiered together and exposed all around the table, they all led back to the monitor or keyboard. At the hole the chameleon reaches into his coat withdrawing the long steel rod. His hands work like fluid over the object, pulling back an extension at its end, flipping a switch at its base and gliding it up to his bulging eye. Steading his arm, positioning his legs in a sturdy formation, he puts the typer at the end of the barrel. With a strong piston motion the extension is pushed in with a loud click, there's a sound of air being sucked into a vacuum, from out of the barrel shoots a fist sized fireball. It curls across the air, leaving a splendorous trail and calling itself a meteor. Reaching its target it does not stop but continues on its journey, passing through the jellatenous form his clothes becoming transparent allowing the fireball to be seen hitting the wall on the other side and briefly lighting it on fire.<br/>
	The chameleon gasps, running quickly into the room he draws up his firestick welding it like a club. With a powerful stroke it swings down at the typer's head, it strikes only the ground beside his image, sparks fly in all directions. A loud hiss emerges from the chameleon's lips.<br/>
	"Such a fool." Casually the words drift across the room from a darkened corner. The Chameleon turns, his firestick ready. The human figure raises his hand, the chameleon crouches readying for some sort of projectile. His fingers bend, there's a crunch behind the chameleon, before he can react the man brings his hand to a fist, the wall behind the chameleon crashes into his spine both shattering.<br/>
	The light on the monitor flickers on, the figure at the keys remains typing, the figure in the corner sits once again meditating in the darkness.<br/>
